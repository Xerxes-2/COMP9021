# Personal Quiz and Assignment code for UNSW COMP9021 Principle of Programming

___Quiz_4___ score __2.80/3.00__ for time out so I made a new version.

___Quiz_6___ score __0.75/3.00__ for my laziness, but the algorithm is already included in ___Ass_2___ so I donn't want to make a new version.

Other quizes and assignments all scored __full mark__.
